# JBubbleBobble OLD VERSION
A tribute to the original game by TAITO. Written in Java.

Media files are missing for copyright reason, contact me to have the full working project to try it out, or check the code here on github. I'm currently working to fix this little issue.


UML is provided.

You can also find a project explanation in Italian, i will translate it soon.


I'm reworking the whole project, look for "JBubbleBubble" at : https://github.com/ale70029/JBubbleBobble
